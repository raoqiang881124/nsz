# NSZ

A compression/decompresson script (with optional GUI) that compresses or decompresses Nintendo Switch dumps losslessly thanks to the [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) compression algorithm. The compressed file can be installed with supported NSW Homebrew Title Installers.

## Mirror

A Swiss mirror of this repository is hosted at <https://gitlab.nicobosshard.ch/nicoboss/nsz>.
This will be the new home in case GitHub ever takes down nsz. Please bookmark it.

## Running this tool

There are several ways to run this tool. Choose from one of the methods below.

**You need to have a hactool compatible keys file in a suitable directory to use this tool**.

You must legally obtain your keys!

The keys file must be named either `prod.keys` or `keys.txt`. It must be located either in the `nsz` folder or:

| OS      | Location                                                        |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | `$HOME/.switch/`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nsz/`, `$HOME/.config/nsz/` |
| macOS   | `$HOME/.switch/`                                                |
| windows | `%USERPROFILE%/.switch/`                                        |

You can also provide a custom keys path at runtime using the `--keys /path/to/prod.keys` parameter. This may be a direct path to the file or a directory containing `prod.keys` / `keys.txt`.

For a compact terminal progress style use `--minimal-output` to print only `<percentage>% <current step>`.

### Linux, Windows, and macOS binaries

You can find the binaries in the [release](https://github.com/nicoboss/nsz/releases/) page.

On most Linux systems you will need to right-click the file, open the properties, and choose to "Allow executing file as program".

Mac systems are much more strict about which software is allowed to be ran on the system. You must make the file executable from the terminal with `chmod +x nsz-cli-macos` or `chmod +x nsz-gui-macos`. After trying to run the program you will be stopped by security. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security then scroll down and choose to allow running the program.

**The methods listed below require you to have [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads) and pip3 installed.**

### PIP Package

Use the following command to install the console-only version:

`pip3 install --upgrade nsz`

Use the following command to install the GUI version:

`pip3 install --upgrade nsz[gui]`

### Android

1. Install "Pydroid 3" and the "Pydroid repository plugin" from the Play Store
2. Open "Pydroid 3" and navigate to "Pip"
3. Enter "nsz" and unselect "use prebuild" then press install
4. Navigate to "Terminal" to use the "nsz" command
5. The first time it will tell you where to copy your prod.keys which you should do using the "cp" command
6. Use any command line arguments you want like "nsz -D file.nsz" to decompress your game

### Running from source

The tool can be run from the [source code](https://github.com/nicoboss/nsz/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

1. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements or `pip3 install -r requirements-gui.txt` to install the requirements for the GUI.
2. Run `python3 nsz.py` to start the program.

## Docker Container

NSZ is available as a Docker container with multi-architecture support for easy deployment and usage without needing to install Python.

The container provides:

- **Multi-architecture support**: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/arm/v7, linux/ppc64le
- **Optimized size**: ~88MB Alpine-based image
- **Easy Nintendo Switch keys mounting**
- **Shell-like command usage**

For complete Docker setup, build instructions, and usage examples see [container/README.md](container/README.md).

Quick example:

```bash
# Build for local testing
make -C container build-single-arch

# Use with your Nintendo Switch keys
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/data -v "$HOME/.switch/prod.keys":/root/.switch/prod.keys nsz-tool:latest game.nsp
```

              [file ...]

positional arguments:
  file

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -C                    Compress NSP/XCI
  -D                    Decompress NSZ/XCZ/NCZ
  -l LEVEL, --level LEVEL
                        Compression Level: Trade-off between compression speed
                        and compression ratio. Default: 18, Max: 22
  -L, --long            Enables zStandard long distance mode for even better
                        compression
  -B, --block           Use block compression option. This mode allows highly
                        multi-threaded compression/decompression with random
                        read access allowing compressed games to be played
                        without decompression in the future however this comes
                        with a slightly lower compression ratio cost. This is
                        the default option for XCZ.
  -S, --solid           Use solid compression option. Slightly higher
                        compression ratio but won't allow for random read
                        access. File compressed this way will never be
                        mountable (have to be installed or decompressed first
                        to run). This is the default option for NSZ.
  -s BS, --bs BS        Block Size for random read access 2^x while x between
                        14 and 32. Default: 20 => 1 MB
  -V, --verify          Verifies files after compression raising an unhandled
                        exception on hash mismatch and verify existing NSP and
                        NSZ files when given as parameter. Requires --keep
                        when used during compression.
                        NOTE: Some hash checks will be skipped when processing a ticketless dump file.
  -Q, --quick-verify    Same as --verify but skips the NSP SHA256 hash
                        verification and only verifies NCA hashes. Does not
                        require --keep when used during compression.
                        NOTE: Some hash checks will be skipped when processing a ticketless dump file.
  -K, --keep            Keep all useless files and partitions during
                        compression to allow bit-identical recreation
  -F, --fix-padding     Fixes PFS0 padding to match the nxdumptool/no-intro
                        standard. Incompatible with --verify so --quick-verify
                        will be used instead.
  -p, --parseCnmt       Extract TitleId/Version from Cnmt if this information
                        cannot be obtained from the filename. Required for
                        skipping/overwriting existing files and --rm-old-
                        version to work properly if some not every file is
                        named properly. Supported filenames:
                        *TitleID*[vVersion]*
  -P, --alwaysParseCnmt
                        Always extract TitleId/Version from Cnmt and never
                        trust filenames
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of threads to compress with. Numbers < 1
                        corresponds to the number of logical CPU cores for
                        block compression and 3 for solid compression
  -m MULTI, --multi MULTI
                        Executes multiple compression tasks in parallel. Take
                        a look at available RAM especially if compression
                        level is over 18.
  -o [OUTPUT], --output [OUTPUT]
                        Directory to save the output NSZ files
  -w, --overwrite       Continues even if there already is a file with the
                        same name or title id inside the output directory
  -r, --rm-old-version  Removes older versions if found
  --rm-source           Deletes source file/s after compressing/decompressing.
                        It's recommended to only use this in combination with
                        --verify
  -i, --info            Show info about title or file
  --depth DEPTH         Max depth for file info and extraction
  -x, --extract         Extract a NSP/XCI/NSZ/XCZ/NSPZ
  --extractregex EXTRACTREGEX
                        Regex specifying which files inside the container
                        should be extracted. Example: "^.*\.(cert|tik)$"
  --titlekeys           Extracts titlekeys from your NSP/NSZ files and adds
                        missing keys to ./titlekeys.txt and JSON files inside
                        ./titledb/ (obtainable from
                        https://github.com/blawar/titledb).
                        NOTE: This parameter has no effect when processing a ticketless dump file.
  --undupe              Deleted all duplicates (games with same ID and
                        Version). The Files folder will get parsed in order so
                        the later in the argument list the more likely the
                        file is to be deleted
  --undupe-dryrun       Shows what files would get deleted using --undupe
  --undupe-rename       Renames files to minimal standard:
                        [TitleId][vVersion].nsz
  --undupe-hardlink     Hardlinks files to minimal standard:
                        [TitleId][vVersion].nsz
  --undupe-prioritylist UNDUPE_PRIORITYLIST
                        Regex specifying which dublicate deletion should be
                        prioritized before following the normal deletion
                        order. Example: "^.*\.(nsp|xci)$"
  --undupe-whitelist UNDUPE_WHITELIST
                        Regex specifying which dublicates should under no
                        circumstances be deleted. Example: "^.*\.(nsz|xcz)$"
  --undupe-blacklist UNDUPE_BLACKLIST
                        Regex specifying which files should always be deleted
                        - even if they are not even a dublicate! Be careful!
                        Example: "^.*\.(nsp|xci)$"
  --undupe-old-versions
                        Removes every old version as long there is a newer one
                        of the same titleID.
  -c CREATE, --create CREATE
                        Inverse of --extract. Repacks files/folders to an NSP.
                        Example: --create out.nsp .\in
  --machine-readable    Restricts terminal output and reports in a way that
                        is easier for a machine to read.
```

## File Format Details

### NSZ

NSZ files are functionally identical to NSP files. The file extension difference is to alert the user that it contains compressed NCZ files. NCZ files can be mixed with NCA files in the same container.

As an alternative to this tool NSC_Builder also supports compressing NSP to NSZ and decompressing NSZ to NSP. NSC_Builder can be downloaded at <https://github.com/julesontheroad/NSC_BUILDER>.

### XCZ

XCZ files are functionally identical to XCI files. The file extension difference is to alert the user that it contains compressed NCZ files. NCZ files can be mixed with NCA files in the same container.

### NCZ

These are compressed NCA files. The NCAs are decrypted then compressed using zStandard.

The first 0x4000 bytes of a NCZ file is exactly the same as the original NCA (and still encrypted). This applies even if the first section doesn't start at 0x4000.

At 0x4000 there is the variable sized NCZ Header. It contains a list of sections which tell the decompressor how to re-encrypt the NCA data after decompression. It may also contain an optional block compression header allowing random read access.

All of the information in the header can be derived from the original NCA + Ticket, however it is provided pre-parsed to make decompression as easy as possible for third parties.

Directly after the NCZ header, the zStandard stream begins and ends at EOF. The stream is decompressed to offset 0x4000. If block compression is used the stream is split into independent blocks and can be decompressed as shown in <https://github.com/nicoboss/nsz/blob/master/nsz/BlockDecompressorReader.py>.

CompressedBlockSizeList[blockID] must not exceed decompressedBlockSize. If smaller: the block must be decompressed. If equal: the block is stored in plain text.

```python
class Section:
 def __init__(self, f):
  self.magic = f.read(8) # b'NCZSECTN'
  self.offset = f.readInt64()
  self.size = f.readInt64()
  self.cryptoType = f.readInt64()
  f.readInt64() # padding
  self.cryptoKey = f.read(16)
  self.cryptoCounter = f.read(16)

class Block:
 def __init__(self, f):
  self.magic = f.read(8) # b'NCZBLOCK'
  self.version = f.readInt8()
  self.type = f.readInt8()
  self.unused = f.readInt8()
  self.blockSizeExponent = f.readInt8()
  self.numberOfBlocks = f.readInt32()
  self.decompressedSize = f.readInt64()
  self.compressedBlockSizeList = []
  for i in range(self.numberOfBlocks):
   self.compressedBlockSizeList.append(f.readInt32())

nspf.seek(0x4000)
sectionCount = nspf.readInt64()
for i in range(sectionCount):
 sections.append(Section(nspf))

if blockCompression:
 BlockHeader = Block(nspf)
```

## Local development

The fastest way to get a development environment running is to open this repository within Visual Studio Code while you have the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension by Microsoft installed. This guarantees all developers have the same environment.

You will be prompted to reopen the repository in the container. From the container run `.devcontainer/build-*.sh` or one of the build tasks from the `Terminal` > `Run Task...` menu.

Binaries you build will be in dist/{os}/nsz.
